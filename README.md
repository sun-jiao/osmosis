# Osmosis

My own branch of Osmosis.

Unlike a disgusting official version, you can use XmlReader with an InputStream in my Osmosis.

My XmlReader works in same way as the PbfReader.
If PbfReader can use an InputStream, I don't understand why XmlReader cannot do the same thing.

If someone is biased against me, or feels that my commits will stain their repository, I would rather maintain a version myself.
