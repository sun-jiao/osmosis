# Osmosis

My own branch of osmosis.

You can use XmlReader with an InputStream in this osmosis.

My XmlReader works in same way as the PbfReader.
If PbfReader can use an InputStream, I cannot understand why XmlReader cannot do the same thing.

If someone is biased against me, or feels that my commits will stain their repository, I would rather maintain a version myself.
